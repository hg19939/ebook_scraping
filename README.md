# Scraping free tech-related e-books

## Project's goal
This project was developed during the first two weeks of the author's Frontrunners internship at the [University of Essex](https://www.essex.ac.uk/) as a research assistant. The goal is to crawl the [FreeTechBooks](https://www.freetechbooks.com/) website, collecting data such as titles, plots, and download links about the presented books.
