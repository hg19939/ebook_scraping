# Scraping free tech-related e-books

## Project's goal
This project was developed during the first two weeks of the author's Frontrunners internship at the [University of Essex's CSEE department](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/computer-science-and-electronic-engineering) as a research assistant. The goal is to crawl the [FreeTechBooks](https://www.freetechbooks.com/) website, collecting data such as titles, plots, and download links about the presented books. The data is then saved as an Elasticsearch index for maximum efficiency uppon querying.
